Customers simply put their purchases on a FuturePay tab, making it easy to buy now and pay later. They only need to enter their email and password to complete their purchase in one step, without leaving your cart.Merchants who offer an alternative payment method see higher average order values and increased repeat sales. And because we verify each purchase, FuturePay allows you to better serve your customers and protects both merchants and shoppers at checkout. There’s no risk to you because we pay you guaranteed and we are responsible for collecting the payment from the customer.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1IinjM2AvM]= How does FuturePay work for my customers? = With FuturePay customers can shop online without a credit card. Plus, FuturePay streamlines the customer’s checkout experience, requiring only one step which makes it ideal for your mobile customers.
